When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository would be helpful for collaborating with others. Also, it is useful if I use different computers to manage a single repository.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I may have made changes to my local repository that have not been pushed to the remote repository and automatically pulling from remote may cause conflict.
