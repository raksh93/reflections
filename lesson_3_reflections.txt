When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository would be helpful for collaborating with others. Also, it is useful if I use different computers to manage a single repository.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I may have made changes to my local repository that have not been pushed to the remote repository and automatically pulling from remote may cause conflict.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used to copy remote repositories that one doesn't have permission to edit.
Clones are used to simply copy remote as well as local repositories.
Branches are used while adding experimental changes,fixing bugs etc. to maintain a separate 'working copy'.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This serves as a reference point when making a pull request.



How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Making edits to existing files is a lot more difficult without using Git as keeping track of changes made to a large number of files can become very chaotic.
